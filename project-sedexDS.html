    <h3>🧩 The Challenge: Previous Platform</h3>
    <p >A siloed UX team and a heavily customised off-the-shelf design system had created an overly complex, inconsistent component library with layout issues. There were too many components and styles, and without clear guidance, it caused confusion.</p>

<p >The front-ends weren’t using reusable components, so a big part of the project was gaining their trust and getting them to adopt a shared approach. I worked closely with the front-end architect to align on standards and rebuild the foundation.</p>

<p >👥 Around 40% of Sedex core members, a group of key buyers regularly involved in feedback on the platform, said the site felt jumpy and like moving between different sites instead of one smooth platform.</p>

    <h3>⚙️ Approach & Process: Starting from scratch</h3>
  <p>There were far too many components and styles. Without clear guidance, this led to inconsistent UIs and confusion across teams. I decided to start again — gave the team only the basics, built around core MUI components. From there, we rebuilt gradually, introducing new components through ceremonies with clear usage and rationale.</p>

<p style="font-size: 12px; font-style: italic;">
  The basic system covered 12 colours for brand, UI states and feedback, two typefaces with two scales, buttons and text buttons, form fields, a single atom icon, and a library of over 100 icons with clear usage guidelines. It also included an icon button, responsive grids, and spacing rules with variables. I added paper backgrounds, toggles, switches, headers and footers. We defined things like border radius, elevation, and basic interaction states to keep everything consistent and dev-ready. Everything was kept lean and practical — just what the team needed to move quickly without reinventing things.

    <h3>⚙️ Approach & Process: Driving Efficiency </h3>
    <p >To keep the design system practical and adaptable, I ran weekly ceremonies to introduce new components and gather feedback. We landed on MUI as a library to streamline front-end development. A key part of the process was getting both UX and front-end teams to adopt the new system — not just by documenting it, but by embedding it into our workflows and demonstrating how it could reduce duplication, speed up handoffs, and improve consistency across the platform.</p>

                    <p class="project-description">As we moved into the second phase of the design system, working with a PM we kicked off some discovery work around dashboards — a major part of the Sedex platform. The old setup was one-size-fits-all for all user. I started with an audit, then worked with front-end to build a flexible, widget-based dashboard that could adapt to different users and their progress in the platform. Even though 98% of users were on desktop, I designed all components to be fully responsive and backed the mobile-first approach with data.<br> <br> ✏️ Getting this right meant understanding user needs, defining personas, and reworking the IA to match.

                    <p class="project-descriptionl">With the design system starting to grow through ceremonies and with my own knowledge of the platform improving over time.

  <div class="text-half fade-slide-up">
    <h3>🧱 Navigation Components: Clean and Clear IA</h3>
    <p >Sedex audits rely heavily on supplier data, requiring users to provide lots of information. Clear navigation for buyers and intuitive steps for suppliers were essential to guide them smoothly through the process. The site’s structure combined both hierarchical and matrix approaches, so it was important to organise information clearly through effective pathway design.</p>
    <p >👥 User surveys revealed that around a quarter of supplier users often felt lost in the platform and had trouble navigating it, highlighting the need for clearer information architecture and more intuitive navigation patterns.

  <div class="text-half fade-slide-up">
    <h3>🧱 Long-form questionnaires</h3>
  <p>Our design system focused on a component library for long-form questionnaires. We created reusable components to enable efficient, consistent, and user-friendly questionnaires. <br><br>Lengthy questionnaires were a major hurdle, often leading to high dropout rates because they felt overwhelming to suppliers. A huge part of Sedex's businesses model relies on capturing data from suppliers or goods and services. Our solution was to gamify them, breaking down data collection into clear, manageable sections. <br><br>👥 User testing in the SAQ team showed us people were still dropping off, so we iterated, making sections even shorter and incorporating varied input types to keep users engaged and improve completion.</p>

    <h3>🧱 Tables: From Chaos to Consistency IA</h3>
    <p >Each area of the platform was using tables differently. Standardising them was crucial for improving performance, streamlining development, and—most importantly—ensuring consistency for users.</p>
    <p > To guide this, I studied Notion’s table implementation, which provided valuable insights for creating powerful and adaptable table functionality in our system.
</p>
<p> 
As with our dashboard widgets, I designed these table components to be generic and flexible, able to handle various content and interactions. This allowed different product squads to use them across the platform. I also developed extensive guidelines to ensure consistent and correct usage across all scenarios. Strong file organisation made implementing this complex system manageable.</p><p>I also examined the information architecture of tables, opening up a matrix structure that allowed users to filter and navigate different areas of the platform more easily. Clear labelling and intuitive navigation were key to cutting out jargon and reducing friction.
  <br><br>👥 Tables were particularly important in the linking section, so I collaborated with that product squad to test new designs as part of their regular user testing. These sessions were valuable for validating usability improvements across the platform.

    <h3 >🧱 Widgets: Flexible, Modular & Multi-Use</h3>
    <p >These components came directly out of the discovery work around dashboards. I needed a way to support different user types and stages in the lifecycle, without redesigning the wheel each time. So I built a set of flexible, modular components that could be reused across contexts — from new users onboarding to experienced users tracking progress. Each one was designed to show feedback clearly, reflect user progress, and adapt to the role or task at hand. Everything was built to be multi-use and easy for the front-end team to plug into.

  We defined tokens to be intuitive for designers and easily mapped to front-end code. The structure followed patterns like (usage/heirachy/colorusage/theme)  <span class="highlight">background/primary/success/light</span> for colour and for typography we defined primitives for each typographic element to standardise them. 
  Primitives used clear labels such as <span class="highlight">XSmall</span>, <span class="highlight">Small</span>, <span class="highlight">Base</span>, <span class="highlight">Large</span>, and <span class="highlight">Light</span>, applied across elevation, spacing, radius, and line height.
